<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not

name) to the <br>
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>

by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>
<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
 Works a copy of this License; and<br>

 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
 those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
 Works; and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its <br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not <br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of <br>
 the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
such <br>
 additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
 the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in

You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make

under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered 
Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform 
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how 
they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software 
exchange.<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You 
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent 
that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation
(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications 
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You 
may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark 
notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of 
licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any 
Contributor or the Initial Developer.<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered 
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may 
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of 
Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, 
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and 
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered 
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a 
license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable form does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code 
form from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which 
differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred 
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
any such terms You offer.<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software

must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Software.<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and 
may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from 
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing 
version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other 
than the license steward has the right to modify this License.<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise 
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the 
Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise 
made available under any subsequent version of the License, You 
must distribute and make the Covered Software available under 
the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also 
choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
published by the license steward.<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>

subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the 
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent 
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such 
jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located 
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained 
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible

reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods

indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You 
agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
